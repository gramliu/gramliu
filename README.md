### Hi there 👋

# I'm Gram Liu

🎓 CMU Electrical and Computer Engineering '23

🖥️ Fullstack Engineer

👨‍💻 Tech Enthusiast

This summer, I was a SWE intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) working on [Terminal](https://stripe.com/terminal), where I built a first-of-a-kind CI testing framework and test suite for our readers.

Last summer, I was a SWE intern at [Dashlabs.ai](https://www.dashlabs.ai/). I built the digital memberships platform for the Philippine Red Cross, which helped expedite the roll out of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.

I'm also an undergraduate research assistant at the CMU CHIMPS Lab, where I developed a privacy-focused IoT app development framework. Right now, I'm building a decentralized app ecosystem, enabling people to share the ambient data collected by their smart home sensors.
