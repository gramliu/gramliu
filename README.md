### Hi there 👋

# I'm Gram Liu

🎓 CMU Electrical and Computer Engineering Major

🖥️ Fullstack and IoT systems developer

👨‍💻 Tech Enthusiast

This past summer, I was a SWE intern at [Dashlabs.ai](dashlabs.ai), building platforms to automate medical laboratory pipelines.

I'm also an undergraduate research assistant at the CMU CHIMPS Lab, where I developed a privacy-focused IoT app development framework. Right now, I'm building a decentralized app ecosystem, enabling smart home owners to share the ambient data collected by their sensors.
