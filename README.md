### Hi there 👋

# I'm Gram Liu

🎓 CMU Electrical and Computer Engineering '23

👨‍💻 Tech Enthusiast

I'm currently at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) in San Francisco 🌉 where I work on [Tap to Pay](https://stripe.com/terminal/tap-to-pay).

In 2022, I was a SWE intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) working on [Terminal](https://stripe.com/terminal), where I built a first-of-a-kind CI testing framework and test suite for the Terminal POS card readers.

In 2021, I was a SWE intern at [Dashlabs.ai](https://www.dashlabs.ai/). I built the digital memberships platform for the Philippine Red Cross, which helped expedite the roll out of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.

I was also an undergraduate research assistant at the CMU CHIMPS Lab, where I developed a privacy-focused IoT app development framework ([10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833629](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833629)). I also designed and built a framework for building privacy-first serverless smart city applications. Here, I designed and developed a domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime for running these smart city applications. The last project I worked on for my honors thesis was a new system that reshapes how applications on the Internet manage and request access to our personal data through OAuth.
